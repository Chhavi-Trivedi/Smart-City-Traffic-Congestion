Industry 4.0,subset of the fourth industrial revolution that concerns industry. The fourth industrial revolution
encompasses areas which are not normally classified as industry, such as smart cities for instance."Industry 4.0" 
refers to the concept of factories in which machines are augmented with wireless connectivity and sensors, 
connected to a system that can visualise the entire production line and make decisions on its own.
<br>
A Smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic Internet of Things sensors 
to collect data and then use these data to manage assets and resources efficiently.

<H3>TRAFFIC CONGESTIONS- A MAJOR SMART CITY PROBLEM</H3>
<p>
Traffic congestion is a condition on transport that as use increases, 
and is characterised by slower speeds, longer trip times, and increased vehicular queueing. 
When traffic demand is great enough that the interaction between vehicles slows the speed of the traffic stream,
this results in some congestion.This is a common problem in our country especially in urban areas where people 
have busy lifestyle are always on the their toes.<br>
Team MAC aims at solving problems related to this using computer 
codes,algorithms,online survey and webpage designing.  
</p>
<H3> ONLINE SURVEY </H3>
<P>
Team MAC conducted an online survey on 20th september 2019 through Google forms,<a href="

</a>
to get ideas about general public experience in traffic congestions and to highlight their views on probable 
causes,problems and probable solutions.
</p>
We discovered the following during this survey:

<H3> OUR SOLUTION:</H3>
<p>A smart city that uses internet of things would count the no. of vehicles in a particular lane using a various 
traffic sensoring technologies.These sensors includes inductive loops,non intrusive traffic detection devices video cameras and video image processing.
 Our solution make use of the data provided by these sensors.it basically priorities the lane with heaviest 
 traffic load for switching green signal,instead of normsal switching method.In a situation where two lanes has same ammount of traffic load, priorities 
 would be given to the lane which is in the waiting state (red light ) for a longer time.</p>
