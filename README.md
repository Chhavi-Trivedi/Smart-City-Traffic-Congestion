# Smart-City-Traffic-Congestion

## PROBLEMSü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

There are several severe problems that could be caused by traffic 
congestion including-<br>
1. Late in work.<br>
2. Emergency situations are delayed.<br>
3. Noise and air pollution leading to adverse effect.<br>
5.Violence and frustration increases among passengers and commuters.<br>
6.Exhausting and tiring experience.<br>

## OUR SOLUTIONüîß‚öô

A smart city that uses Internet Of Things(IOT) will count the number of vehicles in a particular lan, using various traffic sensoring technologies (LiDAR, acoustic fibre, virtual loops, etc).These sensors include inductive loops, non-intrusive traffic detection devices, video cameras and video image processing.

Our solution make use of the data provided by these sensors. It basically priorities the lane with heaviest traffic load for switching green signal ,instead of simple switching method. In  a situation where two lanes has same amount of traffic load, priorities would be given to the lane which is in the waiting state ( red light ) for a longer time. <br>
